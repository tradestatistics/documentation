# About

This documentation is a hard attempt to try to explain how to use the scripts created to process the data available from [Open Trade Statistics](https://tradestatistics.io/) and how to use our API. 

We made all the scripts available under the [Trade Statistics Organization](https://github.com/tradestatistics).
