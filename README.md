# Trade Statistics Documentation

## Description


This documentation is an attempt to try to explain how to use the scripts that generate the data that powers [Open Trade Statistics](https://aaa/). 

We made all the scripts available under the [Trade Statistics Organization](https://github.com/tradestatistics).

The documentation was generated by using bookdown and is served via gh-pages. Please visit https://tradestatistics.github.io/ts-documentation/.

Everything in this repository is released under GNU license.
