# About

## Project goals

Open Trade Statistics is an independent project that values reproducible research and provides tidy trade data. We are heavily inspired by R community values and Open Licenses views on freedom.

We focus on commodities data and our added value, unlike many other good trade data projects, is that we focus on data processing and reproducibility instead of data visualization.

We advocate for openness and collaboration, so our contribution is focused on:

* Releasing all of our source code on GitHub
* Releasing snapshots of the software we use
* Sharing curated data (direct download and API)

Besides open data we don't track users, we don't want your personal information and we use https to protect your navigation and our service.

Our goal is to ease data analysis, promote a reproducibility culture, and do something towards a better internet.

## Data availability

We used different trade classifications according to the data availability.

|Classification |Availability|
|---------------|------------|
|HS rev 1992    |1992 – 2017 |
|HS rev 1996    |1996 – 2017 |
|HS rev 2002    |2002 – 2017 |
|HS rev 2007    |2007 – 2017 |
|SITC rev 1     |1962 – 2017 |
|SITC rev 2     |1976 – 2017 |

These datasets were used all together in order to create a unified data series for the period 1962-2017 with all products classified under HS rev 2007.

## Sources

All of the product data shown on the OTS site is classified using either SITC (Standard International Trade Classification) or HS (Harmonized System), the raw data was obtained from [UN COMTRADE](http://comtrade.un.org/) and its under their authorization that we share claned versions of the original raw datasets.

## Code

We made all the scripts available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tradestatistics). Pull requests and new ideas are always welcome!
