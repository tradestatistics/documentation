We are heavily inspired by R community values and Open Licenses views on freedom. We focus on commodities data and our added value, unlike many other good trade data projects, is that we focus on data processing and reproducibilidy instead of data visualization. Our goal is to ease data analysis and promote a reproducibility culture. We advocate for openness and collaboration, so our contribution is focused on: Releasing all of our source code on GitHub Releasing snapshots of the software we use Sharing curated data (direct download and API) 1.2 Data availability We used different trade classifications according to the data availability. Classification Availability HS rev 1992 1992 – 2017 HS rev 1996 1996 – 2017 HS rev 2002 2002 – 2017 HS rev 2007 2007 – 2017 SITC rev 1 1962 – 2017 SITC rev 2 1976 – 2017 These datasets were used all together in order to create a unified data series for the period 1962-2017 with all products classified under HS rev 2007. 1.3 Sources All of the product data shown on the OTS site is classified using either SITC (Standard International Trade Classification) or HS (Harmonized System), the raw data was obtained from UN COMTRADE and its under their authorization that we share claned versions of the original raw datasets. 1.4 Code We made all the scripts available on GitHub.
